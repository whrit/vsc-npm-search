# Contributing to NPM Package Search

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the NPM Package Search VS Code extension! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- pnpm 8.x or higher
- VS Code (for testing the extension)
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vsc-npm-search.git
   cd vsc-npm-search
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Compile the extension:

   ```bash
   pnpm run compile
   ```

5. Open the project in VS Code and press F5 to start debugging

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

This project uses:

- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **pnpm** for package management

### Running Scripts

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
pnpm run compile

# Watch mode for development
pnpm run watch

# Run linting
pnpm run lint

# Fix linting issues automatically
pnpm run lint:fix

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Package the extension
pnpm run package

# Publish to marketplace (requires VSCE_PAT)
pnpm run publish
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes following the coding standards

3. Test your changes:

   - Run `pnpm run lint` to check for linting issues
   - Run `pnpm run compile` to ensure TypeScript compiles
   - Test the extension functionality in VS Code

4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new search functionality"
   ```

5. Push your branch and create a pull request

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
